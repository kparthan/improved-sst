Mixture modelling is widely  used  in  clustering  applications.   We  focus  on
mixtures of directional data that are distributed on  a  sphere.   The  analogue
of Normal distribution is von Mises  Fisher  (VMF)  distribution  on  a  sphere.
We use Minimum Message Length (MML) paradigm of Bayesian inference to infer  the
number of components and the parameters that correspond to a mixture model where
each component is a VMF distribution.  We demonstrate its effectiveness by using
these  models  to   delineate   secondary   structural   elements   in   protein
structures.  The three dimensional geometry of  protein  structures  allows  for
grouping of torsion angles between the successive protein coordinates.   Mixture
modelling of these directional data allows for segregating  data  with  specific
properties.   Each  of  the  secondary  structural  elements  exhibit   specific
geometric interactions and this can  be  leveraged  to  build  a  mixture  model
for each kind of interatomic behaviour.  Each of  the  mixture  model  can  help
represent a secondary structural element.  Using these  statistical  models,  we
assign  secondary  structure  to  a  stretch  of  residues  within  a   protein.
