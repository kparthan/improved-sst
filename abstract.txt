The three dimensional geometry of protein structures allows for grouping
of torsion angles between the successive protein coordinates. Mixture modelling
of these directional data allows for segregating data with specific properties.
Each of the secondary structural elements of protein structures exhibit specific 
geometric interactions and this can be leveraged to build a mixture model
for each kind of interatomic behaviour. Each of the mixture model can help
represent a secondary structural element. Using these statistical models, we
assign secondary structure to a stretch of residues within a protein. 
We use Minimum Message Length encoding to infer the number of components
and the parameters that correspond to a mixture model.
